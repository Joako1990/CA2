FRA,Le METRO BOULOT DODO a t'il ses limites ?,"Welcome to the mid-30s crisis, more and more of us are experiencing it. I did it at around the same age as you and I handled it in the worst possible way, so here's what I can offer you to avoid doing the same:

- Take a step back. Your job doesn't need to be your life or your identity. If you find a job and feel good enough to make it your life, you can, no judgment. But that’s clearly not your case today.

- Set limits. As long as your job isn't your life, it doesn't have to take up all your time either. Is there a culture of presenteeism where you live? Is it necessary to work a lot of hours to do the job, or do you have a little leeway when it comes to organizing your time? If it's the first case, you'll need to put strategies in place to regain some control over your schedule, because you'll need some for the future:

- Find something that gives you meaning, that makes you proud to be you. The way I say it most often is to find *something that comes naturally to you when you start the phrase “I am”*. You are not a finance employee. What are you ? You may be a singer, a dancer, a polyglot, an athlete, but you don't know it yet. You earn a good living, what is your salary for? Personally, I went through singing, percussion, the swimming pool, half a dozen modern languages, tai chi, yoga and dance before finding what made me tick. And it was with vibrancy that I came out of my mid-thirties crisis, but it took me a good five years to get there. You can do it faster.",2023-11-03 10:35:13,0.17728787878787877,Positive

So at one point I said to myself, either I become bitter at 33, or I push a little further.
In the end, at the same time as work, I took up a doctoral thesis.
3 years after the end of the thesis, I am considered a real ""expert"", so I only do the interesting part of the job as an external consultant and extremely well paid.

FRA,Le METRO BOULOT DODO a t'il ses limites ?,"I'm 26 years old and I work abroad in a big company. I am by far the youngest of my colleagues and we have 15% women. I earn a good living and the job is quite nice, but I don't really have a connection with my colleagues who are much older than me and are men with families and children. At my previous job I also experienced a lot of condescension and sexism because of my young age and gender. It doesn't help that I don't speak the local language very well (they all speak English fluently, but of course speak Danish among themselves) even though I study it.


This is how I see things: I plan to stay for the next 4 years because that is when I will leave the salary increase level. I tell myself that around the age of 30 I will analyze what I want to do and where I want to go. Until then, I will try to earn a good living and put as much aside as possible for a possible new start (moving to another country, it will also depend on if I meet someone with whom to share my life). Giving myself goals and a “deadline” helps me not to be impatient, because I also want to move too. I know I won't be satisfied with this life but right now I need it. I like to cultivate my dreams and desires in my head. Moving here was part of it.


I hope this helps you! Good luck, you don't have to go to work to sleep if you have the opportunity to do what you want :)

FRA,Metro Paris,">how to find your way when taking the metro/rer

All lines have a number, which is written in a colored circle specific to each line (yellow for line 1, purple for 14, etc.). When you arrive at a station and need to make a connection, all you have to do is follow the signs. Except in Châtelet, it is rarely complicated.
Important: when looking for your way and slowing down/stopping, you should not do so at the top of the escalators or in the path, but move away from the flow of people/

>Is there an app to know which metro to take to get to our destination?

Citymapper, Vianavigo, the RATP app, IDF mobility...

>And the Navigo pass, I still don’t understand how it works

I really don't see how it's complicated: you subscribe (by the day, by the week, by the month or by the year) and it allows you to take any means of RATP/SNCF transport throughout the 'Ile-de-France. Small trap: stations at the ends of lines outside Ile de France (like the RER D from the white terminal in the north/Malsherbe in the south) are not included.

>I have a great fear of getting lost when taking the metro in Paris

Be careful, the method that I am going to reveal to you is a secret that has been passed down orally for decades between initiated people: if you are lost, you approach a person (ideally [those in a gray suit with a green striped tie/scarf and blue and sporting an RATP badge](https://www.upromi.com/upromi/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ARC_RATP-2.png), but it works with any person).You plant your gaze in that of the chosen person and then be careful, everything gets carried away, you have to be reactive:

* You start with a greeting, a “hello” will do just fine at any time
* The machine is started, you only have a few moments while the person responds to your politeness to bounce back: “excuse me, I got lost, could you tell me how to get back to X”

Normally you have your answer but BE CAREFUL it's not over, the misstep is still possible, it would be a shame to come across as an asshole so close to the goal. It is indeed necessary to conclude with a new mark of politeness such as “Thank you and have a good day”.

Well I know, it seems simple because I've been practicing for years, my advice is to train with loved ones a few weeks before departure.


Last thing: the metro is certainly the quickest way, but the underground is not necessarily the best view of Paris. If you can, try to stay on the surface by taking the bus or a self-service bike!",2023-05-19 06:26:48,0.08846738057264374,Positive
FRA,Metro Paris,"First you need to learn how to read a map and signs. The problem does not seem to be Paris, but rather understanding a map and the signs.

To make an itinerary you need to determine:

\- what is the closest station to your departure point

\- what is the closest station to your destination

\- which line(s) allows you to travel between these 2 stations.

Once you know which line to take, you need to check the direction.

But basically, Google Maps already does it for you. If you can't use Google Maps, you can practice where you are and try to see if you can follow a route on foot.

The difference between this and a metro ride is that Google Maps will tell you which line to take and in which direction. The direction is indicated on the signs in the station and on the platform. The exits are numbered (number or letter) and Google Maps will also tell you which exit to take once you arrive at your destination.

But it's like that everywhere in the world, not just in Paris.",2023-05-19 06:22:02,0.25,Positive
FRA,Metro Paris,"In Paris, the metro is almost always organized like this: a certain number of surface entrances which generally communicate with each other at the information and ticket processing point. There may be some which are reserved for the exit or which do not lead to exactly the same place but in any case, a station = a name = access to all the lines served regardless of the entrance.

So the first step is to know the names of the stations that you will use most often, that's good, they serve as a point of reference for everyone, much more than the names of the streets. You will very often hear “it’s in Nation” “I’m going to Havre-Caumartin” etc.

Then you need to join your line. They are numbered and colored and the direction in the corridors is indicated at each intersection in 99% of cases, so you just have to follow the route, it is only in very very large interconnected stations like Châtelet or Saint Lazare that this can be a little difficult to find your way around, but you end up learning the routes by heart.

Generally, the route to join the line splits in two to serve the platforms, because there is rarely a common platform, one platform = one direction. At the entrance to the platform there is always a sign indicating the stops served, so if your stop does not appear it is probably the wrong direction. It's organized like this:

One line = one color and one number + two terminals.
You have to learn to find your way around the terminus, for example line 1 in yellow, serves La Défense and Château de Vincennes. You must therefore know, in relation to where you are, if your stop is towards Château de Vincennes or La Défense and follow the corresponding signs.

Here again we use the maps and apps at the beginning, but very quickly we remember the direction of the terminus. Line 1 goes from east to west, so for me who lives far to the east, La Défense is the direction of the outward journey and Château de Vincennes on the return route.

Sometimes we have to make a connection, it's the same logic: we identify with an app or the map at which station the two lines intersect and once on the platform of the station where we have to change lines we locate the numbered colored sign and we follow the route in the direction of the terminus that interests us.

Once arrived, the best thing is to know which exit is closest to us and the applications are very practical for that, otherwise there are pedestrian maps of the area and exits on the platform.

As an application I recommend CityMapper which will divide the route into simple steps to follow",2023-05-19 06:44:25,0.12973710317460319,Positive

It costs 5 euros per person, and you can put a week on it (€22.15). Be careful, it's not rolling 7 days, it's from monday to sunday. But still, if you buy it only for a week-end (so usable from friday to sunday), it will be cheaper than the 1-day ""Paris Visite Pass"".

Why it's awesome:

- You get a magnetic pass. No more searching for the right ticket. So you can follow the first rule more easily.
- Usable in every public transport: bus, metro, RER, Transilien, tramway, including Montmartre. There's a few exceptions (OpenTour buses, Orlyval) but it's all you'll ever going to need.
- Access to every Noctilien (night buses).
- It has a 10-year long validity. So you can reuse it everytime you travel to Paris.
- All zones are included. Wanna go to Disneyland? You can. Versailles? You're fine! Come back to CDG airport for the return trip via RER? You also can!
- Dedicated gates at most stations for Navigo users.
- It's anonymous, no name or e-mail BS.
- Finally, no more ticket refilling. Charge it once and you're fine until the end of the week.

Also, good thing to know: bus, metro and tramway service always end one hour later on Fridays, Saturdays, and every day preceding a national holiday (like July 13). This doesn't apply to RER and Transilien.
