DEU,Why does Germany not have turnstiles at train stations/metro stations?,Because it's forbidden to use a train without a ticket.,2022-12-20 21:33:11,0.0,Neutral
DEU,Why does Germany not have turnstiles at train stations/metro stations?,"The train station in my hometown doubles as a throughway/shortcut (how to translate Unterführung??) from one side of the village to the other. Loads of people access it without any intention of taking a train, so you’d have to redesign the whole thing in order to add turnstiles without making the throughway inaccessible. That’s just one single example, so I guess the question is less “why are turnstiles not added now” which, just not feasible since loads of places would need to be restructured/redesigned, and more “why were they not designed for in the first place”.",2022-12-21 00:12:10,0.09781746031746032,Positive

DEU,Why does Germany not have turnstiles at train stations/metro stations?,"In addition to all the other points, I'd like to add that there are so many different tickets that allow you onto trains/trams/buses/etc that adding turnstiles would be a massive PITA. For example, I have a BahnCard 100, but someone else has a 4-stamp card, and someone else has a ticket specifically for a single destination. They would have to overhaul all of those tickets in order to have them comply with a single system, or employ someone at every station to check every ticket that wasn't turnstile-compatible.",2022-12-20 21:51:06,0.0386904761904762,Positive
DEU,Why does Germany not have turnstiles at train stations/metro stations?,"I was in the Netherlands recently, and I concluded that the main reason they have turnstiles is because a turnstile manufacturer worked very hard at convincing the railway authority that this was the way to do things. 

I also thought that the turnstile manufacturer was getting a cut out of each data processing event. That's why they designed a system which involves so much checking in and checking out. This is to say that the biggest beneficiary of this system was the turnstile company. 

But the system sucks. I do not believe that the Dutch are any more or less likely to go without tickets than Germans. But the Dutch system is slow and annoying, slow to enter, slow to exit, the tickets have to have an added surcharge because they aren't simple paper tickets they are RFID/NFC tickets. God help you if you accidentally swipe out but don't leave fast enough and then you're stuck inside. In theory, in an emergency, the gates would automatically open, but that depends on the emergency. A fire alarm should trigger that, but I can imagine other types of emergencies where people would get stuck because there is no clear way for the system to know that there is an emergency worth opening the gates for.

Once I got back to Germany I thanked god that we don't have to deal with that awful system.",2022-12-21 02:07:33,-0.08428030303030304,Negative
DEU,Why does Germany not have turnstiles at train stations/metro stations?,"Depends on where you live. Where I live there are at least 20 different ways to be eligible to ride the trains.

Some of those do not have a ""ticket"". 

For example if you have a Schwerbehindertenausweis  (severely handicapped pass) you are allowed to ride public transportation for a small yearly fee or even free and you are allowed to bring a support person with you for free.

Students have public transportation included in their semester fees.

Soldiers in uniform are allowed to use public transportation for free.

If you have a long-distance ticket with the DB you often are allowed to use public transportation to your final destination for free, and you can also book a ""city"" option with your ticket where you can use all public transportation within a city for a small extra fee.

There are tickets that are valid for a full day or even weekend.

&#x200B;

In the end those turnstiles would be able to check potentially dozens of different tickets. Some that are valid for hours, days or even month or years. Some are only valid for a specific amount of stops (Kurzstrecke/short distance). Some don't even have a physical ticket (e.g. a solider in uniform).

So being able to check the ticket and then figure out if the customer is allowed to pass is a nightmare of complexity.",2022-12-20 22:50:14,0.09690909090909092,Positive
DEU,Why does Germany not have turnstiles at train stations/metro stations?,"It's not just Germany that does this: it's the norm in many other countries as well, and the name for this system is ""proof of payment"" -- because you need to be able to prove that you paid the fare if you are ever challenged.

Ticket barriers have a lot of disadvantages. First, they cost money: they have to be designed, built, operated, maintained, updated, and eventually replaced. Every station is designed differently, so there's no simple one-size-fits-all solution that would keep costs down.

Ticket gates can also cause bottlenecks, and at peak periods that's a big problem. A partial solution is to have tap-in points without physical barriers, but that still causes bottlenecks and delays -- they're just not so bad. Also, it makes it possible to enter the station without paying so you then still need ticket inspectors *as well as* the whole tap-in system. Also, you have the problem of people tapping in and forgetting to tap out again. You could potentially use RFID technology so that people are booked in and out as they enter and leave a station without needing to find their ticket, but that would create even more problems: if it's not sensitive enough it might fail to book people in who would therefore be riding without a valid ticket but without intending to, or fail to book people out; if it's too sensitive it might book people in who are merely walking past and charge them for journeys they didn't make.

Physical barriers are also a major hazard if a station needs to be evacuated for any reason. Of course in the event of an emergency the gates would obviously simply open and remain open, but they still form obstacles that would roughly double the time it takes to evacuate the station or even, if there is a panic, increase the chances of people being injured or even killed.

There are a lot of stations that can't have barriers installed for various reasons. It's common even in places like London for smaller stations to have no physical barriers, but again this means you're not saving any money on ticket inspectors.

Even larger stations would be problematic. Take, for example, Aschaffenburg Hbf, a station I know very well. Platforms 1 and 2 are directly accessible from the main hall, while all the other platforms are accessible via a foot tunnel. If you put one ticket barrier in the main hall for access to all the platforms at once, you would also end up with the luggage lockers, information desk and waiting area behind the barrier. If you put one ticket barrier in place for platforms 1 and 2, and a second barrier for the tunnel, you force some passengers who are just changing trains to go through two ticket barriers. And the whole thing is impossible anyhow because the tunnel also provides pedestrian access to homes and businesses on the other other side of the station; it was specifically built for that, and effectively closing it off would be a huge inconvenience for a lot of people.

And of course the technology can fail. Physical barriers can simply jam; software can be buggy or glitchy, and potentially miscalculate fares or even fail to open gates or book passengers in and out properly. There are instances of this happening in many places, but because a lot of these systems have a kind of ""black box"" approach -- passengers don't need to worry about getting the right ticket, they just tap in and tap out and trust that the system is working as intended -- passengers are less likely to notice.",2022-12-21 08:34:00,-0.0036722612542284695,Negative

DEU,Fine metro,">Im from the Netherlands and my german is quite good. On the way there we bought a ticket in the bus,  on the way back i didnt see a ticket machine on the smaller metro stop so we planned to buy one in the next station.

That's interesting, even in bumfuck nowhere Bavaria, I've seen ticket machines for trains in this country. 

Regardless, if your friend has a ticket for themselves that works on their card and is valid for that region, they shouldn't be fined. And yes, from experience, if they in any way know your address (which is at least the case on my own ID card as an example), they'll figure out a way to fine you. You'll get a letter in your mail for this sometime in the future if they hold to it.

I would recommend in the future if you visit, use the DB app for tickets. That way they can't harass you for anything if you flash them a mobile ticket and/or QR code.",2023-09-23 14:53:50,0.17424242424242425,Positive

DEU,"Just visited Germany, have some questions I couldn't get answered while there","> No turnstiles or ticket processers for the local trains

Or *any* trains, and this isn't all that unusual. The concept is called ""proof of payment"": there are no ticket gates, but there are random spot checks and if you don't have proof that you paid for the journey, you can be fined (€60 or twice the adult single fare, whichever is greater); repeat offenders can be prosecuted. Tickets are checked not on platforms, but on the trains.

This system avoids bottlenecks caused by ticket gates, especially important in an emergency, and avoids problems caused by malfunctioning gates; additionally, it makes it easier to design stations. It does make fare dodging easier, but it also makes it easier to accidentally ride without a valid ticket (e.g. you didn't notice your ticket was expired, or you bought the wrong ticket, or you dropped your ticket somewhere). Most people, however, do buy tickets.

Proof of payment systems have actually been implemented in some places in the US -- most famously buses and trams in San Francisco have recently switched to proof of payment.

> we noticed a lot of empty reserved seats as well. Is this common?

It sometimes happens that business travellers in particular might buy a ""flexible"" ticket (allowing them to use any train on that day) and reserve seats on multiple trains, and then only use one of the reservations. No shows can also happen if a train is delayed resulting in passengers missing a connection. Also, of course, check the display that shows which station the seat is reserved from: most reservations are only reserved for part of the whole journey.

Any reservation that is not claimed expires after 15 minutes.

> We noticed tiny house communities across many of the towns and cities of Germany

The famous ""Kleingartenkolonien"" a.k.a. ""Schrebergärten"". These are basically allotments, small plots of land that can be rented and used as gardens: most people also put up a little house that they can chill out in, although they're not supposed to live there.

They were originally created for working-class city dwellers where they could get a little fresh air and supplement their diet by growing their own vegetables -- it was seen as a public health thing. They were most often built on unused land near railway lines, so if you were travelling by train you'll probably have seen a lot of them.

I'm not 100% sure about this, but I think you may have seen a [Schrebergarden or Kleingarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotment_\(gardening\)) (which I just learned is called an ""allotment"" in English!). People here don't have their own large lawns so cities often have these green spaces where you can I guess ""rent out"" a plot of land to have a little shed and a garden of your own? I think they are also community owned so you sort of ""buy"" into the club. Somebody with actual experience should answer this though.

DEU,"Just visited Germany, have some questions I couldn't get answered while there","1.) Yes, most locals buy tickets or have month/year subscriptions to their respective comuter route even if the tickets are not controlled often. It's a bit of a honor system, but it's also tied to heavy punishments if you are caught travelling without a ticket. Once or twice will only give you a fine of about 60-80 Euros each, but repeat offenders can be punished as criminals and it can have a long term effect on your police record. So most people don't risk it. 

2.) Seats are often reserved from the start of a train route even if the passanger enters later, or are reserved from when the last passanger left to the next, even if there are 3 hours in between. They figured it's easier to reserve a seat for a person even if that person isn't going to sit in it for another 3 hours yet, than to switch to reserved sometime on the way and need the staff to get people who sit there off of these seats. Plus, a few old trains still need the staff to put the ""reserved"" markers on the seats, and it would be too much work to just do that on the raod somewhere. Staff has basically nothing else to do but constantly run up and down to control tickets on long distance travel, so that would just be too bothersome otherwise. 

3.) I am not sure what you mean with tiny homes. What I understand as tiny homes is relatively rare. If you've seen small huts with gardens around them at the sides or train tracks or at the edges of towns then these are garden colonies. It's a bit of a cultural thing that people living in the city or town own or rent small garden areas with small huts out in garden colonies and alongside the unwanted ground along train tracks. People plant their own veggies there, have some time in nature, and take care of these gardens - but you are not allowed to life full time there or sleep there more than a few nights. These gardens also have commitees that control them which are probably the closest to a HOA as you will ever come in germany.  

4.) As I wrote in another comment already, packages around here are delivered majorly by DHL or Deutsche post. Amazon prime and a ton of private deliverers are still somewhat of a minority, and often don't deliver with branded cars but unmarked vans or private vehicle. So you might have seen yellow small trucks and vans driving around - this is DHL and Deutsche post. As for the packages - Packages are usually not simply dropped off at the door. That they just leave your packages at pre-determined drop off spots around your house is still a relatively recent thing and still not common. Mail people will ring and try to deliver your package personally, hand it to a neighboor so you can pick it up with them, or take the packages with them again to try another time. When they've tried three times to deliver and couldn't so so, they will take it to a Deutsche Post service station where you can pick the package up during the following week. So you won't see packages just laying around in the open even in the most secure neighborhoods, and even less so in a city.",2023-04-27 14:17:00,0.05987654320987654,Positive

It's in fact a crime, so they can get you arrested if you do it too often. It's called ""Erschleichung von Leistungen"" and is one of very few laws that survived the end of WW2... so it's a Nazi law and heavily discussed. But yea, in Berlin there are plenty of ppl driving for free. And there are several subway routes that are just very rarely checked and you can spot those guys from a mile, if you know what you have to look for.
2. With a BahnCard you can reserve a seat for free. If you take a different train it stays reserved until you give the seat free. Not everyone does that tho. If a seat is reserved there's always a route from where to where it's reserved. If you are at that route and there's no-one sitting in that seat, you can just sit down. If the seat is reserved but you are not yet in the reservation zone, sit down and leave if you reach the station where the ppl whose seats you're sitting on get on to the train.
3. That's odd. Tiny homes are not yet regulated in Germany. Not regulated means, it's not allowed to use the address of your tiny home for your registration. You can use it as a holiday home, but not as your actual home.
4. What do you mean? Does Amazon just leave your packages in front of the houses? In Germany it's delivered by a parcel service and if you're not at home they either try the next day or deliver your package to a packing center nearby. That can be a post office or the next kiosk. Sometimes it's not the next one but the furthest one... and there's one parcel service that sometimes drops it at ""your neighbor's"" three blocks away. So just because you don't see them doesn't mean they are not there. They clog shops in the surrounding area and also the hallways of ppl living on the ground floor. Seriously, I'm living at ground floor and always wonder how much ppl have to buy until they finally have enough stuff. I don't get it...
