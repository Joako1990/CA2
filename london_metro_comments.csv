Tube Strike notice in The Metro,52 days leave for station staff!,2015-08-05 06:57:02,0.0,Neutral
Tube Strike notice in The Metro,"So I'm stuck between my various ideologies here.

I want there to be strong unions, who have the capacity to strike in order to present their grievances. The more power we can provide workers, the less chance there is of the government just decanting the entire population into a Dickensian workhouse (which really feels like the Tory endgame at this point).

But on the other hand, two strikes in a month, absolutely no compromise on the march of progress, benefits some of us would murder for... Tube staff are doing a better of fucking perception of unions than Thatcher ever could.",2015-08-05 08:38:22,0.05833333333333334,Positive
Tube Strike notice in The Metro,">**Tube strike**

>I am sorry that your journeys this evening and tomorrow will again be disrupted by the unions.

>We listened to their concerns over work-life balance and put forward an extremely fair revised offer:

>- An above-inflation average two per cent salary increase this year and an inflation proof
rise in 2016 and 2017.
>- Staff on Night Tube lines or stations will be paid £500 once the service is introduced on 12 September.
>- Station staff will receive a £500 bonus in February 2016 for the successful completion of the modernisation of customer service, currently being carried out.
>- Drivers, who already work shifts covering 24 hours, will receive an extra £200 per Night Tube shift during a short transition period, after which they will have the choice whether or not to work Night Tube shifts.

>Drivers will have the same number of weekends off as now and no one will be asked to work more hours than they do today. Everybody will remain entitled to two days off in seven. Annual leave will remain at 43 days for a train driver and 52 days for station staff.

>The unions rejected this fair offer outright and instead demanded more money, the hiring of even more staff - including for ticket offices that customers no longer use - and a 32 hour four day week. No employer can afford to meet those sorts of demands.

>We continue to urge them to call off the strike, put the new offer to their members and not subject Londoners to further unnecessary disruption. We remain available for talks at any time.

>If the strike goes ahead, please complete your journeys on the Tube by 18:30 tonight.

>There will be no Tube service on Thursday 6 August.

>Please check at [tfl.gov.uk/tube-strike](http://tfl.gov.uk/tube-strike)",2015-08-05 07:24:08,0.18442760942760944,Positive
Tube Strike notice in The Metro,"Every time I read/hear about an argument from either side, it's never clear. TFL say drivers don't have to work night shifts. They hammer that point across all the time. And Unions say they don't want to work night shifts. So what the hell?

""Drivers who already work shifts covering 24 hours...#"" - 24 hours over how long? A week? 2 days?

""Will recieve an extra £200 per Night Tube shift during a short transition period"" - How long is that?

""After they will have a choice..."" - So every driver can say they don't want to work a night shift?

And even then the population was smaller and ac less common. It's expensive to retrofit the old infrastructure and trains aren't updated that often.

International Metro systems vs London,"They hadn't built most of the Istanbul one last time I was there.

The Greek one is simple, spacious and functional, but large stations operate with no visible staff at all. So if half the machines won't take cards or your ticket doesn't make the gate open, you're a bit stuffed. 

NYC is just like the movies, with mad people going strange things. Children are expected to crawl under barriers, accessibility is crap compared to London.

Paris smells of rubber and as they let anyone with suitcases in free via the side gate, I've not paid for a ticket in 20 years. 

Berlin, Munich, other German cities are functional. Vienna was rather lovely. Tokyo JR and tube and Kyoto subway were great - thankfully signs are also in English.

I'm rather fond of Glasgow's clockwork orange and its little trains, but it's probably claustrophobic in rush hour.

International Metro systems vs London,"London is the original standard, but China has really improved on it and taken the best of all metro systems. They have essentially copied and pasted the same metro system into all their cities and it works really well, though it can get hellishly, cartoonishly packed at rush hour. Same with Seoul in all respects, and a minor niggle is I don't like the metal seats without dividers because you can and will slide across the bench. I forget what the ticketing system is like in China, but in Seoul you use a T-Money card and it can also be used in taxis, buses, convenience stores and on the transit system in some other cities like Busan.

Hong Kong is also very similar but slightly older, their Octopus cards inspired the Oyster card but was infinitely more useful before contactless tech (you could use it in stores as well, and it was useful for the kids of working parents). Their AC is set at unhealthily low temps though, which is bad for your health and the environment.

Athens metro updated their ticketing system recently. It used to be like Berlin's where you had no gates so you could just not pay at all and OASA lost a lot of revenue because of this. Now there are gates, they still use paper tickets but you can also get oyster-style cards where you can buy season tickets. They don't have AC on their carriages but they're not that deep down and they all have windows so it's usually okay. It does have a pick-pocket problem, moreso than the previous systems I talked about (but Asia is kind of different when it comes to crime anyway) and you are basically guaranteeing becoming a victim if you have your phone dangling in a loose pocket. It's a small system, with some really interesting stations in the centre (like one with a track that passes right up against an archaeological site)

HK has the best ran system in the world with the highest on-time rate almost every year and being the main mode of public transport for over 7 million people. That said, the HK metro system makes money off of property management since the metro company owns the land where stations are built upon which allows them to build malls and residential buildings above as well as owning a significant stake of the octopus card company (oyster cards copied after them). So in reality the metro company makes more money than they can spend which goes back to very affordable ticket prices that drives bus companies out of business as well as paying dividends to the gov and smaller stakeholders. Plus, the city is geographically tiny compared to London or Greater Tokyo so cost can be focused on keeping the facilities in top condition.",2023-08-09 13:46:25,0.23974358974358975,Positive

Literally cars driving around a neighbourhood targeting people of a specific religeous group and shouting hate speach at them and threatening to rape their family members. All on camera. Arrest them on the spot and let the courts decide if the videos are enough to sentence them.

If a group of white people went around a mainly muslim area doing the same they'd be stopped pretty quick im sure.

Allowing this to happen will just make things worse. They sent so many officers to the peaceful quiet Sarah Everard vigil and dragged people away and arrested many but for stuff like this fuck all happens. Priorities always look fucked when it comes to the police. Same with anti lockdown protests, many police at the Sarah Everard vigil dragging people away for not following social distancing but then a gathering specifically against social distancing gets left untouched.

Ended up splitting a taxi with 3 random people as we had no other option to get to Heathrow. The taxi queue itself took about an hour after everyone realized it was the only way to get to the airport.  The ride took ANOTHER 50-60 minutes with how bad traffic was.  One of the strangers graciously paid for the ridiculously high £120 fare as his company would expense it.

Central government instructed TFL to maintain a near full service during COVID with zero income . TFL introduced measures to barrier contact and central government sanctioned a period on nil fares.

Post COVID TFL has been denied sufficient funding (other than short term loans) and Has been INSTRUCTED by the Transport Department that funding offered comes with strings ( TO YOU SERVICE CUTS MATE!! )

That said the mayor has managed to save and preserve much of the bus network quite well.
