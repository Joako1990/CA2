Always a good idea for people to pay attention to who is sitting close to you - big red flag if they are alone and choosing to sit right next to your seat.

IRL,Abuse in the Luas to tourists,"If it can make you feel a little better, my gf once witnessed two Irishmen in the Luas standing up to teenage bullies.

Three Irish kids (she said they looked around 13 yo) syarted harrassing this family of mum, dad, and two kids. The reason? Their skin was dark. She told me they were even calling them n-words.

As I me tuoned two guys stood up and told them to fuck off and be ashamed of themselves. They then apologised to the family on their behalf.

The Irish kids didn't stop acting like pricks, but at least someone stood up for that poor family.",2023-03-17 10:46:52,-0.09375,Negative
IRL,Abuse in the Luas to tourists,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m Irish and white.

Some Irish teenagers are awful, I was working in a large retail shop, and I was putting product out at the till area, there was a large group of lads in their teens in the queue, they kept saying sexual things to any girl they saw, I could see some women being uncomfortable so I told them to stop, we exchanged a few words back and forth, then one of them said a really sexually explicit thing he would do to me. It was to get under my skin it wasn’t something I took as a serious threat, but it was really upsetting. 

There were a lot of other people in the queue, men and women, none of them spoke up, I could see the other staff on the tills deliberately slow down because they didn’t want to be the ones to serve them.

I went to get security but he didn’t do anything and was waiting for backup, I don’t know the reason why he couldn’t have interfered in some regard, anyway I made sure to stand at the end of the till and just stood there staring them down until they left, of course security finally made an effort as they’re leaving and escorted them out.

I’ve stood up against people being abusive or racist to others a few times, but it is hard when you’re alone and it’s a group of people. 

We definitely need to tackle this on a societal level.

They definitely attack anyone that’s different or vulnerable, and it’s always when they’re in groups, they wouldn’t say boo to you when they’re alone.",2023-03-17 12:28:12,-0.06509406231628455,Negative
IRL,Abuse in the Luas to tourists,I experienced the same sort of crap a few years ago. I live in Holland and was back in Dublin with the other half. We were sitting upstairs on the bus when two lads got on and sat behind us. They heard us talking a foreign language and almost straight away started talking shite about foreigners. The little shitheads kept it up for a few minutes presuming that the dumb foreigners couldn't understand them. Eventually I turned around and asked them in my Dublin accent if they had a problem. Needless to say the look on their faces was priceless. Other passengers around start laughing at them. Little fucks were so embarrassed they got off the next stop.

IRL,Abuse in the Luas to tourists,">and I dare to say borderline delinquent, behaviour of gangs of teenage boys and girls.

You're not saying anything outrageous or controversial here, it's not borderline, it's outright delinquent behaviour. They're a minority in this country but they still leave a large enough negative impact that it makes us hate them. If the majority of people would just jump in and kick the shit out of these type of people, they'd learn their place in society and not be so quick to hassle random innocent bystanders. I don't care if they're kids or lads or girls, anyone engaging in that type of behaviour deserves to get the shit kicked out of them by the larger majority groups of good people in the country, and there should be no legal repercussions for doing so",2023-03-17 13:09:21,-0.02514880952380954,Negative

If you wonder why people are reluctant to intervene, here's one incident that illustrates a possible outcome.

\>Sean Squires (19) stabbed the victim after the young man attempted to intervene in an argument between Squires and his then-girlfriend on a Dublin Bus in August 2021. Squires was 17-years-old at the time of the incident.

IRL,Abuse in the Luas to tourists,"I'm a foreigner living in Ireland as well, I have witnessed one or two incidents of suggested racism. I can relate to you when you see *no one* step up. One of those times, I had a fighting urge to stand up, but as a student in my teen years, there was nothing much in my power to do to fend off a over looking adult. Back when there were reports of people harassing ""Chinese"" or similar looking people, I was scared to the nick. Those people didn't deserve to be treated like that. Not just some of the Irish, but other parts of the world, too. It's just a hard society to live in with all these news stories.

Don't get me wrong, majority of the Irish people are *very* nice, and I appreciate that. Others, not so much.",2023-03-17 09:05:02,0.0356926406926407,Positive
