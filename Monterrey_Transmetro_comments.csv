MEX,"Esto acaba de pasar en el transmetro de No reelección, tengan cuidado","The worst thing is that you are probably not the last one this will happen to at the hands of this guy. If the individual is already daring to do this type of thing for sexual satisfaction, it means that he is already a victim of his own impulses and has an imbalance. In his anemic situation, until he faces SERIOUS consequences, I think there will be a probability of a little awareness on his part, that is, he has to carry his dick so that he learns not to go around giving those blowjobs!

It is very difficult to say that there is a solution to this, I hope the next time I want to do that there are brave people to stop that behavior.

I hope you are well and remember that that person is sick, what he did had nothing to do with you and the good thing is that it did not happen to adults.

I'm going to tell you about the experience that a friend told me about, several years ago, who accidentally found a good solution; I hope it helps you and all the women who read this comment.

She was in a truck accompanied by a classmate from her school, they were both sitting, and at some point a man who was standing next to them got on; The guy turned out to be an exhibitionist who started showing his genitals to these girls. They obviously got scared, they didn't know what to do, and they got so nervous that they started laughing without being able to control themselves... and that laugh was the solution, the guy immediately covered himself, made a ""swallow me dirt"" face and that's it. He didn't know where to hide or where to run.

These HDSPM are generally very insecure and cowardly men, you may not have the strength to beat them as they deserve, but you can give them a good psychological mothering game by laughing at their miseries.
