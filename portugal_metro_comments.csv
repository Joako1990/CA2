second: these situations are really difficult because you are probably the only person who saw/felt them. you can try to say something: stop touching me; can you give me space?

As others have said in the comments, the best thing to do is say something like: get there, get out of my space or keep your hands to yourself. I think you shouldn't be the one to change your life and your journey just because of some perverts on the train.

And not just in transport, on the street, where alone girls and women are caught. I've been followed, I've had these perverts brush by me and I've lost count of the number of times cars slow down or follow while they can.
The solution is when possible to leave the situation, ignore it or if there really is abuse, confront it but knowing that no one will help. Unfortunately, I only once had someone get involved. I was at a bus stop full of people and a man crossed the street and came to sit next to me and he was almost on top of me and talking at me, no one at the stop moved or said anything (I was a teenager and it was full of adults), luckily a man stopped the car and shouted at him to leave me alone and he got scared and ran away.",2023-07-09 07:47:11,0.15432098765432098,Positive

I was going to work at Kalorama (I started at 1pm) and I got out in front of the train which, after starting to move, stopped very suddenly. I looked around and didn't understand what was going on, I decided to ignore it and keep walking because I was already late and that's when it all started. I saw people running towards the gates to try to escape with terror and panic on their faces, it looked like something out of a movie. I decided to run away, not knowing what could happen and as I went up the stairs I tried to find someone to explain why. Many didn't know why, but when I arrived outside I found a family of 4 people who were in Lisbon for the first time because their eldest son was going to university. The youngest daughter was terrified and none of them wanted to get back on the subway to get to their destination. It was then that the father (I assume) said that he saw the man coming in and that he immediately found his posture strange, then someone saw the man wielding a knife and people forced the doors to leave. I don't know if he pointed it out to someone or if he made some kind of threat, but something caused a general panic.

We also spoke to the police officer who was redirecting traffic because of the festival, who tried to reassure us but said that it would be very difficult for them to do anything about the man and that he most likely ran away among the people.

However, I find it very strange that on a day when there would be a lot of traffic at that metro station, there was not a single security force present that could act in this situation.

Fortunately, no one was injured, but it was certainly a traumatic experience and one that deserved to be talked about more. These types of things cannot continue to happen and no one should be afraid to ride the subway.",2023-09-04 03:19:46,0.05140000000000001,Positive
